# üëã About Me

I'm a backend developer specialized in Java enterprise applications, passionate about solving real-world problems with clean code and robust architectures. I thrive in environments where system integration, API design, SQL optimization, and automation are the main challenges.

With solid experience in large-scale corporate projects, I focus on **Java (JavaEE, JBoss, Maven, Hibernate)**, **REST API design and documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)**, and deep **Oracle PL/SQL troubleshooting**. My day-to-day involves refactoring legacy code, automating pipelines, reviewing code for best practices, and delivering scalable, maintainable solutions.
